## Project TODO: A/B Test Advisor (MVP)

- [x] Step 1: Scaffold React + TypeScript app with Vite in `web/`; run initial build
- [x] Step 2: Add Tailwind CSS (v4 integration via `@tailwindcss/postcss`) and basic layout styling
- [x] Step 3: Add Zod and implement input validation schema + inline error handling
- [x] Step 4: Build UI components — `MetricSwitch`, `VariantTable`, `ResultsCard`, `ExportBar`
- [x] Step 5: Implement math helpers — rates, Wilson CI, z‑test, Fisher's exact, chi‑square
- [x] Step 6: Implement decision engine — select test, compute p‑value, CIs, lifts, winner/leading
- [x] Step 7: Wire UI to decision engine; render stakeholder‑friendly summaries
- [x] Step 8: Copy/export features (copy JSON, copy summary text, print to PDF)
- [x] Step 9: QA with example datasets; small‑counts safety checks
- [x] Step 10: Polish: formatting, accessibility, minor UX details

## Additional Features Completed

- [x] Visual improvements: Enhanced table headers, prominent variant badges, better spacing
- [x] Logic fixes: Equal rates detection, proper A→B→C ordering, blue-purple color scheme
- [x] PDF download: Executive-friendly reports with ECCENTRIC branding
- [x] Educational section: YouTube video integration with concept explanations
- [x] Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader support
- [x] Error handling: Loading states, comprehensive validation, graceful failures
